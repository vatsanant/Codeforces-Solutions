# Codeforces-Solutions
- Contains solutions to Codeforces' problems.
- Solutions are organized in the order they were solved
- Most solutions are implemented in C++, with a few in Python.
- Feel free to make valid changes.

**I HAVE DONE SOME TRASH TALK IN THE COMMENTS OF FEW CODE FILES, SO NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT. I USUALLY DO THIS.**

THESE AREN'T THE ULTRA PRO MAX LEVEL OPTIMIZED SOLUTION, tbh NOT EVEN OPTIMIZED, THESE ARE just solutions,
MY DUMB@$$ BRAIN COULD THINK OF SO ONLY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS.
